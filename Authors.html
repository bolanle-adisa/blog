            <h4>Greetings Everyone!</h4>
            My name is Bolanle. I am a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas. I 
            am a member of the Huston-Tillotson University Women in Tech and I am also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers. 
            I am a W.E.B Dubois Scholar and I currently work as an IT technician on campus. My technical interests include front-end web development and 
            futuristic technology. I want to get into the work force immediately after my obtaining my Bachelor's Degree to not only build new technology but also improve 
            existing ones. Lastly, I hope my contribution to technology is able to provide value to others and improve their standard of living.
