        <h3>How my journey in the tech industry has been so far .</h3>

         Hello everyone! I hope that my unconventional path into technology may 
         encourage anyone else who is considering a career in this field. So here is
         my story!
         <br>
         <h3>My high school years</h3>
         Prior to the start of my college education, I had no knowledge about
         all the perks of being in the tech industry. I attended high school in my home country, Nigeria, 
         where we were given the liberty to decide what career path we wanted to take from an early age. 
         There were three departments, the sciences, commercial and arts, from which I 
         decided to study commercial courses because I intended on have an Accounting major. I graduated 
         high school in July 2019 with a High school Diploma in commpercial courses like 
         Accounting, Economics, Commerce, Banking and Finance and many more.

         <h3>Life after high school</h3>
         Due to the pandemic, I was not able to begin my college education immediately 
         after graduation. During this time, I was privileged enough to join an advising center
         that enlightened me on the benefits having a Computer Science major 
         could provide. This sparked my interest and I went on to do further 
         research. I came across so many success stories of people with similar 
         backgrounds as mine and I decided to start my  journey, hopefully, I 
         will become an inspiration to the younger generation like others were to me. 
         <br>
         <h3>College struggles</h3>
         When I started my coding classes at college, it was hard catching up because 
         it was like learning a whole different language but this challenge did not 
         hold me back. The fear of failure motivated me to utilize resources that 
         I never knew existed. I discovered websites that taught me how to code in 
         c++ and JAVA and in no time, I was excelling. Those resources ensured my success in my classes. 
         <br>
         In addition to learning from online resources, I joined programs designed to 
         improve and empower women of colour in the STEM industry. I go for conferences,
         participate in hackathons and get certifications that have provided me with
         resources to develop myself and discover what part of tech I was most interested 
         in. I also currently work an on-campus job at my university as an IT technician. 
         This job deals with computer hardware. I perform hardware and software installations, 
         perform routine maintainance of computer hardware, attend to complaints made to the IT departments
         Help Desk, print Identification Cards for new and existing students and staff, perform routine
         updates on the universities PC's, amonst other things. I like the exposure this job has provided me 
         because now I am able to know that I prefer dealing with computer software. I am also 
         a Major League Hacking fellow; here, I am learning everyday to be a better open source citizen.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        Not a lot of women were into tech in the past and I am glad that the percentage of women in tech is now rising. 
        I have realized that no matter your background, all it takes is determination to attain success. 
        Currently, I am gaining more experience by gaining internships that would expand my horizon. 
        I am looking foward to growing, developing my skills and gaining new skills as I progress in life.
        Upon graduation with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, I hope to be able to 
        be a part of the strong, successful women in tech and serve as an inspiration to the younger generation.
