        <h3>Why should you develop this soft skill?</h3>

        
 
        A very essential soft skill that would definitely come in handy in a workplace would be the ability to communicate 
        with colleagues, superiors, mentees, customers or anyone else. Many people, including myself, struggle with this but 
        I realised that bringing awareness to the importance of this skill would greatly improve efforts made to communicate 
        effectively and in a timely manner. Communication contributes significantly to internal efforts with team members that 
        directly affect customer relationships, therefore, it is very vital in a workplace.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first benefit of good communication is that it improves productivity. Most times, colleagues work in teams to solve 
        problems, engaged team members with a solid understanding of their roles and responsibilities are typically more productive 
        than unengaged team members. Team members who do not fully comprehend their roles often become frustrated or unsure of their 
        capabilities. Team members may perform their responsibilities more efficiently if the information is readily available and 
        presented effectively. This also ensures problems are solved faster and progress made. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Good communication in a workplace also promotes trust. When leaders set the standard for communication across the company, 
        they form a positive example for team members. These examples encourage collaboration, teamwork, and trust. A trusting work 
        environment excels when colleagues communicate openly. This ensures a healthy relationship among workers. Effective communication 
        is not just for your team. Internal communications are essential, but businesses must also interact with external agents (whether 
        that is a formal sponsorship agreement, reaching out to the public on social media, or answering incoming calls). Effective 
        communication helps organisations connect with their clients, sponsors, and any other external bodies. Customers who feel 
        listened to and valued by an organisation are more likely to stick around. Likewise, businesses with loyal customers gain a 
        reputation for credibility and superior customer service. In summary, it helps improve public relations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Good communication also helps to improve the existing skills of workers. If someone gets stuck trying to figure out a solution 
        to a problem, one of the best ways to find a resolution would be to communicate with someone who has been through the same 
        situation in order to seek advice. This helps to not only solve the problem but also get knowledge on how to solve the problem 
        in case a similar situation is faced at another time. It also fuels innovation. When employees have the confidence to communicate 
        ideas freely, both amongst each other and with senior management, creativity thrives and innovation is born. Not only is that great 
        for the company, but it contributes to employee morale and retention as a result. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When people are gathered in a space, conflicts can arise once in a while. Good communication can help resolve conflicts and reduce 
        tension in the workplace. Conflicts can arise either in-person or in an online environment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        These are just a few reasons why people should maintain good communication. I started valuing good communication when I realised its 
        benefits. I am still working on my communication skills and I hope others can embark on this journey with me and also value theirs.
