        <h3>How I overcame my stage fright</h3>

        
 
        There is always an important event that happens in every person's life. That important event may be graduating from 
        high school, winning a lottery, or even a tragic loss. My important event in life was the day I conquered my fear of 
        public speaking otherwise known as stage fright. Everyone has some type of fear or phobia that absolutely petrifies 
        them. Whether it is a fear of reptiles, swimming, germs or even death, it can be conquered as I discovered. I 
        unraveled this on a beautiful Sunday morning carol service.
        <br>
        I sat, rooted to my seat, anxiously waiting. My heart was pounding making me feel like my rib cage was just about to 
        break. Hands shaking, palms sweating, insides curling with anxiety but still trying my best to look calm and at ease. 
        These nerves were the worst! How does the preacher even do it? If I was told two weeks ago that I'll be in this 
        position, I would have laughed so hard because I just couldn't be called for things like that. I was way too shy. 
        But here I was, earnestly waiting for the 5th reader to be called to the stage.
        <br>
        Sitting there, I kept on chanting in my head, “I will overcome this fear today!” I believed that everything happens 
        for a reason and that is what mollified me even as I felt nervous and nauseous. “Ebunoluwa Adebesin, a round of 
        applause please!” as I heard that I froze. The time had finally come and at that point I just told myself I could do 
        it. I stood up, walking to the steps that would lead to the platform the readers are meant to use, praying as I 
        climbed that I won't trip in my heels which I didn't like wearing because of my 5ft 8' height. I got there, collected 
        the microphone with sweaty palms and faced the audience.
        <br>
        And I started, I tried to make as much eye contact as possible with the audience. Sometimes I hesitated and stuttered 
        but still I carried on. As I read, the only thing that ran through my mind was the fact that I was finally and indeed 
        conquering my fear. I discovered then that once you set your mind to do something and walk through to achieve it, it 
        will surely be done. Really there is nothing stronger than having faith in yourself.
        <br>
        On that stage, as I read to the hundreds of people, I just cleared my head and tried not to think of how I could make 
        a sudden mistake and sabotage everything. Now when I am faced with a situation that scares me, I think back to that 
        day. I may still feel a little fear from time to time, but I know that I can overcome it simply by believing in myself. 
        I believed in myself and every other thing fell into place. And indeed, fear can be conquered!
