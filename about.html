        <h1>About the Power Rangers Blog</h1>
        <br>
        
        <I> Power Rangers Blog is a space where we share our thoughts, life choices, interesting facts about us and 
        the world in general. It is a safe space to vent, share ideas and also ask us questions. 
        <br>
        This Blog is built on a bit of an innovative concept: That a group of talented women can each have thriving 
        solo careers in tech, but can still come together on a regular basis to create and share. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The name came from us just joking around trying to find a name that resonates, carries power and is fun. And we 
        came up with the Power Ranger! We used to love the show when we were kids and always wanted to be a part of them. 
        I guess this is our way of making a difference and fighting crime!
